## Heading 1
    
Our first workshop focuses on research and practice at the intersection of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Blockchains. Trusted hardware provides us with a source of trust rooted in hardware, and they find applications in the design of consensus protocols, mitigating MEV, and well perhaps even improving cryptography protocols. Is the use of trusted hardware too strong of an assumption? Doesn't it trivialize the problem? Isn't it broken?

We will have a series of talks from industry and academia focusing on some of the topics discussed above and perhaps shedding some light on answering some of these questions too!
