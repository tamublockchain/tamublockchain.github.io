### Juan Garay

<ul>
  <h4> Welcome & Blockchain Warm Up </h4>
  </ul>
<ul>
  <b>Abstract.</b> Introducing a new paradigm for decentralization, blockchains have ignited much excitement, for both enabling novel financial instruments and applications as well as for offering alternative approaches for solving fundamental problems in fault-tolerant distributed computing and cryptography.  In this presentation I will overview the basic technology and methods blockchains are based on, laying the ground for the rest of the program. </ul>

Watson Research Center, Bell Labs, AT&T Labs--Research, and Yahoo Research. His research interests include both foundational and applied aspects of cryptography and information security. He is the author of over 180 published works (including articles, patents, and edited volumes) in the areas of cryptography, network security, distributed computing, and algorithms; in particular, he is credited with the first optimal and efficient Byzantine agreement protocol, the first efficient and universally composable zero-knowledge and secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols, MPC over sparse networks, and the first formal treatment of Bitcoin. In addition, Dr. Garay has been involved in the design, analysis and implementation of a variety of secure systems, and is the recipient of a Thomas A. Edison Patent Award, two Bell Labs Teamwork Awards, an IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Award, and an IBM Research Division Award. Dr. Garay has served on the program committees of numerous conferences and international panels---including co-chairing Crypto 2013 and 2014, the discipline's premier conference. He is a Fellow of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR).

###  Oshani Seneviratne
<ul>
<h4> Empowering Decentralization through Algorand's Smart Contracts </h4>
</ul>
<ul>
  <b>Abstract.</b> Algorand is a high-performing blockchain platform that is well-suited for creating decentralized applications (dApps) that are scalable and efficient.
This talk will provide an overview of Algorand's unique features and benefits, with a focus on smart contracts. We will discuss how Algorand's blockchain technology enables decentralized applications that can streamline complex transactions and provide secure, transparent, and verifiable solutions. We will delve into Transaction Execution Approval Language (TEAL), state proofs, Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs), and atomic transfers. We will also discuss other topics, such as decentralized identities, decentralized knowledge management, and the application of useful AI technologies in developing the next generation of decentralized applications using Algorand.
</ul>

<ul>
  <b>Bio.</b> Oshani Seneviratne is the Associate Director of the Tetherless World Constellation and an Assistant Professor in Computer Science. She was previously the Director of Health Data Research at the Rensselaer Institute for Data Exploration and Applications. Oshani obtained her S.M. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under the supervision of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. Before Rensselaer, Oshani worked at Oracle, specializing in knowledge representation, provenance, and healthcare-related research. Her research interests span data integration in knowledge graphs, artificial intelligence, decentralized systems (web and blockchain), and health informatics. At MIT, Oshani conducted research on Accountable Systems for the Web. As part of her Ph.D. at MIT, Oshani developed a novel web protocol called HyperText Transfer Protocol with Accountability.

### Ishan Dhanani
<ul>
<h4>RevPass - A student-led project aimed to revolutionize the Sports Pass</h4>
  </ul>

<ul>
<b>Abstract.</b> The current sports pass system at Texas A&M allows for students to sell their passes on Facebook or group chats, with no official rules or enforcement. This results in a lack of standardization in the selling price and relies solely on trust between the buyer and seller. This creates inequity for students who may not have equal access to all selling platforms and puts the buyer at risk of not getting a fair value. To address this, Texas A&M Blockchain developed a digital sports pass built on the blockchain that can be rented by other students. Furthermore, we've built a marketplace where students can seamlessly rent passes in a trustless environment. We will discuss the development of this project, its features, and a long-term implementation roadmap for the University.
  </ul>

<ul>
<b>Bio.</b> Ishan Dhanani is an incoming Computer Science masters student at Columbia University and the founder of Texas A&M Blockchain. Over the last year, he has build Texas A&M's first blockchain organization and developed partnerships with companies including Avalanche, Starknet, and Polygon

### Le Xie

<ul>
<b>Blockchain and Energy: Understanding the Impact of Cryptomining on the Electric Grid</b>
</ul>

<ul>
<b>Abstract.</b> Blockchain technologies are considered one of the most disruptive innovations of the last decade, enabling secure decentralized trust-building. However, in recent years, with the rapid increase in the energy consumption of blockchain-based computations for cryptocurrency mining, there have been growing concerns about their sustainable operation in electric grids. This paper investigates the tri-factor impact of such large loads on carbon footprint, grid reliability, and electricity market price in the Texas grid. We release open-source high-resolution data to enable high-resolution modeling of influencing factors such as location and flexibility. We reveal that the per-megawatt-hour carbon footprint of cryptocurrency mining loads across locations can vary by as much as 50% of the crude system average estimate. We show that the flexibility of mining loads can significantly mitigate power shortages and market disruptions that can result from the deployment of mining loads.

### Korok Ray
<ul>
<b> Banking in Bitcoin</b>
</ul>

<ul>
<b>Abstract.</b> I argue that the chief function of Bitcoin will be a settlement layer between banks.  I review banking and central banking today, discuss Bitcoin in the context of banking, and speculate on opportunities for future Bitcoin development.
</ul>

<ul>
<b>Bio.</b> Korok Ray is an Associate Professor at the Mays Business School of Texas A&M University, and Director of the Mays Innovation Research Center.  He is a labor economist who researches the future of work. In particular, he investigates how computer science and machine learning can create better electronic labor markets that will become ever more common in a networked society.

<br>

Korok’s core area of research is performance measurement: the study of incentives, risk/reward, and compensation for human performance. This application includes executives, chief financial officers, financial traders, farmers, doctors, teachers, rank and file employees, bankers, and even athletes. His research seeks to create economic models of human behavior and to design incentive systems to achieve better outcomes for all. His tools are economic theory, data science, and some small doses of artificial intelligence.

<br>

Korok earned a BS in mathematics from the University of Chicago and a PhD in economics from Stanford University. He has taught at the University of Chicago and Georgetown University, as well as Texas A&M University.  He also served on the Council of Economic Advisers of the White House from 2007 to 2009 during the historic financial crisis.
