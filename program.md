  <h4> In Trusted BFT components, we (mostly?) trust </h4>
  </ul>
<ul>
  <b>Abstract.</b> Most BFT protocols that leverage trusted components (counters or logs) do so to reduce replication from 3f+1 to 2f+1. In this talk, we identify several issues with this approach that restrict responsiveness and hinder throughput. In some settings, these protocols actually achieve worse throughput (per machine) than systems that do not make use of trusted hardware. We find instead that, to truly leverage the power of these trusted components, one needs to stick with 3f+1 replicas. In this setting, trusted hardware can be used to reduce the number of phases necessary to commit an operation or reduce communication complexity.

<h4> Confidential Consortium Framework: Building Secure Multiparty Applications in the Cloud (Without Handing Over the Keys to the Kingdom!) </h4>
</ul>
<ul>
  <b>Abstract.</b> In the pre-cloud era, computer systems were operated by the organizations which depended upon them. This on-premises approach gave organizations great power over their systems, however, “with great power comes great responsibility” and organizations were left with the ongoing burden of deploying and managing their own infrastructure. Today, Cloud computing has removed much of the responsibility of deploying systems, however, it has also removed much of the power that organizations once had. Organizations must place their trust in the cloud to secure the confidentiality and integrity of their data.
</ul>

<ul>
In this talk, I'll consider whether it is possible to regain control over data in the cloud (great power with none of the responsibility) and even enable multiple untrusted parties to compute together on untrusted infrastructure. I’ll introduce the Confidential Consortium Framework (aka CCF), an open-source framework for building a new category of secure multiparty applications with confidentiality, integrity-protection, and high availability. CCF utilizes hardware-based trusted execution environments for remotely verifiable confidentiality and code integrity, backed by an auditable and immutable distributed ledger for data integrity and high availability. CCF even enables application developers to bring both their own application logic and a custom multi-party governance model, in the form of a programmable constitution. By the conclusion of this talk, I hope to have convinced you that distributing systems does not necessarily mean distributing trust in the era of trusted execution in the cloud. You can learn more about CCF today at: https://ccf.dev/

<h4> Building Decentralized Trust with a Trusted Execution Environment</h4>
  </ul>

<ul>
<b>Abstract.</b> The promise of hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) is a place where compute can happen beyond the observation and control of hosting parties. For multiparty applications the TEE can, in theory, become the trusted third party that arbitrates shared "truth". And TEE's can provide this without the redundancy and replication required by software-only alternatives such as distributed consensus protocols. However, there are many examples show that no security technology is completely immune to attack including HW-based TEEs. If TEEs aren't "perfect", what then is their appropriate role in multi-party computations? This talk will go through some of the lessons we've learned about building robust decentralized, multi-party applications with TEEs and how to use a TEE to reduce the risk of successful attacks.

<ul>
<b>Ask not what secure hardware can do for ledgers, but what ledgers can do for secure hardware</b>
</ul>

<ul>
<b>Abstract.</b> Over the past several years, a number of proposals have proposed to use the power of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to provide new capabilities to consensus networks and blockchains. In this talk we will address the opposite direction: how can blockchains be used to enhance the power of TEEs and related technologies? Our answer will introduce the concept of a “proof of publication ledger” and will demonstrate the fundamental capabilities that these systems add to TEE-based systems, including state synchronization, one-time execution, and secure data publication. We further review some recent results from the theoretical cryptography community on the interaction of ledgers and cryptographic obfuscation techniques, as a preview of what may be possible in the future.

<b>Privacy x MEV: mitigation, collaboration, decentralisation</b>
</ul>

<ul>
<b>Abstract.</b> This presentation aims to discuss the utilisation of trusted execution environments (TEEs) and privacy enhancing technologies to mitigate the risks of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). We will start by introducing MEV, highlighting the potential risks it poses to blockchains consensus. Then we will see how Flashbots proposed to handle MEV, via a suite of hosted services spanning PoW and now PoS Ethereum. Finally, we will discuss the research directions Flashbots is pursuing to address MEV through the use of TEEs, and our plans to combine them with privacy-enhancing technologies. This presentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges posed by MEV and give the directions we are currently following so that more collaborators can join us on this open research journey.

<b>Abstract.</b> Come learn about the value of privacy in Web3 and how easy it is to add it to your dApp using the Oasis Privacy Layer, an EVM-compatible privacy solution powered by TEE where state and transactions are encrypted and visible only to the user and the contract. The talk explores the potential of the Oasis Privacy Layer, powered by Sapphire, for adding confidentiality to dApps on any EVM network. Nick will further demonstrate how this technology can help developers build privacy-focused applications on the decentralized web, discuss the challenges and opportunities in blockchain privacy and how to add confidentiality to dApps built on EVM networks within minutes.

<b>Abstract.</b> I'll discuss design challenges and opportunities around TEE-based smart contracts, especially based on our recent experience of coordinated vulnerability disclosures involving access patterns and replay attacks. These are a powerful tool but not a silver bullet, and a bunch of technical debt must be repaid in order to build a secure system that relies on them.

<b>Teechain: A Secure Payment Network with Asynchronous Blockchain Access</b>
</ul>

<ul>
<b>Abstract.</b> We present Teechain, the first layer-two payment network that executes off-chain transactions asynchronously with respect to the underlying blockchain. To prevent parties from misbehaving, Teechain uses treasuries, protected by hardware trusted execution environments (TEEs), to establish off-chain payment channels between parties. Treasuries maintain collateral funds and can exchange transactions efficiently and securely, without interacting with the underlying blockchain. To mitigate against treasury failures and to avoid having to trust all TEEs, Teechain replicates the state of treasuries using committee chains, a new variant of chain replication with threshold secret sharing. Teechain achieves at least a 33x higher transaction throughput than the state-of-the-art Lightning payment network. A 30-machine Teechain deployment can handle over 1 million Bitcoin transactions per second.Joint work with Joshua Lind, Oded Naor, Florian Kelbert, Emin Gun Sirer, and Peter Pietzuch. This result was first published in SOSP'19.
