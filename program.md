  <b>Abstract.</b> Algorand is a high-performing blockchain platform that is well-suited for creating decentralized applications (dApps) that are scalable and efficient.
This talk will provide an overview of Algorand's unique features and benefits, with a focus on smart contracts. We will discuss how Algorand's blockchain technology enables decentralized applications that can streamline complex transactions and provide secure, transparent, and verifiable solutions. We will delve into Transaction Execution Approval Language (TEAL), state proofs, Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs), and atomic transfers. We will also discuss other topics, such as decentralized identities, decentralized knowledge management, and the application of useful AI technologies in developing the next generation of decentralized applications using Algorand.

### Ishan Dhanani
<ul>
<h4>RevPass - A student-led project aimed to revolutionize the Sports Pass</h4>
  </ul>

<ul>
<b>Abstract.</b> The current sports pass system at Texas A&M allows for students to sell their passes on Facebook or group chats, with no official rules or enforcement. This results in a lack of standardization in the selling price and relies solely on trust between the buyer and seller. This framework creates inequity for students who may not have equal access to all selling platforms and puts the buyer at risk of not getting a fair value. To address this, Texas A&M Blockchain developed a digital sports pass built on the blockchain that can be rented by other students. Furthermore, we've built a marketplace where students can seamlessly rent passes in a trustless environment. 
  </ul>

<b>Bio.</b> Ishan Dhanani is an incoming Computer Science masters student at Columbia University and the founder of Texas A&M Blockchain. Over the last year, he has build Texas A&M's first blockchain organization and developed partnerships with companies including Avalanche, Starknet, and Polygon

### Le Xie

<ul>
<b>Blockchain and Energy: Understanding the Impact of Cryptomining on the Electric Grid</b>
</ul>

<ul>
<b>Abstract.</b> Blockchain technologies are considered one of the most disruptive innovations of the last decade, enabling secure decentralized trust-building. However, in recent years, with the rapid increase in the energy consumption of blockchain-based computations for cryptocurrency mining, there have been growing concerns about their sustainable operation in electric grids. This paper investigates the tri-factor impact of such large loads on carbon footprint, grid reliability, and electricity market price in the Texas grid. We release open-source high-resolution data to enable high-resolution modeling of influencing factors such as location and flexibility. We reveal that the per-megawatt-hour carbon footprint of cryptocurrency mining loads across locations can vary by as much as 50% of the crude system average estimate. We show that the flexibility of mining loads can significantly mitigate power shortages and market disruptions that can result from the deployment of mining loads.

### Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach
<ul>
<b>Privacy x MEV: mitigation, collaboration, decentralisation</b>
</ul>

<ul>
<b>Abstract.</b> This presentation aims to discuss the utilisation of trusted execution environments (TEEs) and privacy enhancing technologies to mitigate the risks of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). We will start by introducing MEV, highlighting the potential risks it poses to blockchains consensus. Then we will see how Flashbots proposed to handle MEV, via a suite of hosted services spanning PoW and now PoS Ethereum. Finally, we will discuss the research directions Flashbots is pursuing to address MEV through the use of TEEs, and our plans to combine them with privacy-enhancing technologies. This presentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges posed by MEV and give the directions we are currently following so that more collaborators can join us on this open research journey.

<b>Abstract.</b> Come learn about the value of privacy in Web3 and how easy it is to add it to your dApp using the Oasis Privacy Layer, an EVM-compatible privacy solution powered by TEE where state and transactions are encrypted and visible only to the user and the contract. The talk explores the potential of the Oasis Privacy Layer, powered by Sapphire, for adding confidentiality to dApps on any EVM network. Nick will further demonstrate how this technology can help developers build privacy-focused applications on the decentralized web, discuss the challenges and opportunities in blockchain privacy and how to add confidentiality to dApps built on EVM networks within minutes.

  <b><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/378"> TEE-based smart contracts: pitfalls and challenges</a></b>
  </ul>
  
<ul>
<b>Abstract.</b> I'll discuss design challenges and opportunities around TEE-based smart contracts, especially based on our recent experience of coordinated vulnerability disclosures involving access patterns and replay attacks. These are a powerful tool but not a silver bullet, and a bunch of technical debt must be repaid in order to build a secure system that relies on them.

<b>Teechain: A Secure Payment Network with Asynchronous Blockchain Access</b>
</ul>

<ul>
<b>Abstract.</b> We present Teechain, the first layer-two payment network that executes off-chain transactions asynchronously with respect to the underlying blockchain. To prevent parties from misbehaving, Teechain uses treasuries, protected by hardware trusted execution environments (TEEs), to establish off-chain payment channels between parties. Treasuries maintain collateral funds and can exchange transactions efficiently and securely, without interacting with the underlying blockchain. To mitigate against treasury failures and to avoid having to trust all TEEs, Teechain replicates the state of treasuries using committee chains, a new variant of chain replication with threshold secret sharing. Teechain achieves at least a 33x higher transaction throughput than the state-of-the-art Lightning payment network. A 30-machine Teechain deployment can handle over 1 million Bitcoin transactions per second.Joint work with Joshua Lind, Oded Naor, Florian Kelbert, Emin Gun Sirer, and Peter Pietzuch. This result was first published in SOSP'19.
